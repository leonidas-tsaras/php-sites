                    <h2>Fine Dining</h2>
                    <p>Our hotel is inspired by the global mid-century modern design movement, and in turn, our on-site restaurant and café, Continental, is influenced by cuisines around the world. Famous for her fusion dishes, head chef Layla Wu creates seasonal menus that still have a little bit of English flair. That's right, you can still get your fish and chips, but don't be surprised to taste a little tarragon.</p>

                    <h2>In Hotel Bar</h2>
                    <p>The mixologists at our bar, Refill, create innovative and delicious cocktails with a chemist's precision. Beers crafted by London's best breweries are on tap and rotated monthly to keep our selections interesting. We also have a small stage where musicians and entertainers of all kinds perform for the sensory delight of our guests.</p>
